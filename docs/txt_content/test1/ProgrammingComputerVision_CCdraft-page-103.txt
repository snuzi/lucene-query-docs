Chapter 4

Camera Models and Augmented
Reality

In this chapter we will look at modeling cameras and how to effectively use such mod-
els. In the previous chapter we covered image to image mappings and transforms. To
handle mappings between 3D and images the projection properties of the camera gen-
erating the image needs to be part of the mapping. Here we show how to determine
camera properties and how to use image projections for applications like augmented
reality. In the next chapter, we will use the camera model to look at applications with
multiple views and mappings between them.

4.1 The Pin-hole Camera Model

The pin-hole camera model (or sometimes projective camera model) is a widely used
camera model in computer vision. It is simple and accurate enough for most applica-
tions. The name comes from the type of camera, like a camera obscura, that collects
light through a small hole to the inside of a dark box or room. In the pin-hole camera
model, light passes through a single point, the camera center, C, before it is projected
onto an image plane. Figure 4.1 shows an illustration where the image plane is drawn
in front of the camera center. The image plane in an actual camera would be upside
down behind the camera center but the model is the same.

The projection properties of a pin-hole camera can be derived from this illustration
and the assumption that the image axis are aligned with the :r and y axis of a 3D
coordinate system. The optical axis of the camera then coincides with the z axis and
the projection follows from similar triangles. By adding rotation and translation to
put a 3D point in this coordinate system before projecting, the complete projection
