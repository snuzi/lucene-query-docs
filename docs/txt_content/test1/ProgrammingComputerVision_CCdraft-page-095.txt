Figure 3.1 1: Matching correspondences found between consecutive image pairs using
SIFT features.

â€˜import sift

featname = ['Univ'+str(i+1)+'.sift' for i in range(5)]
imname = ['Univ'+str(i+1)+'.jpg' for i in range(5)]
1={}

d={}

for i in range(5):
sift.process,image(imname[i],featname[i])
1[i],d[i] = sift.read_features,from,fi1e(featname[i])

matches = {}
for i in range(4):
matches[i] = sift.match(d[i+1],d[i])

It is clear from the images that not all correspondences are correct. SIFT is actually
a very robust descriptor and gives fewer false matches than for example Harris points
with patch correlation, but still it is far from perfect.
