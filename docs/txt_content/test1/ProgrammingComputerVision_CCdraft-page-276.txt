left image is the input image with seed regions drawn. The right image shows the
resulting segmentation starting.

This gives two windows like the ones shown in Figure 10.10. One window shows the
source image in grayscale, the other shows the edge map used together with lines
detected as those with most votes in parameter space. Note that the lines are always
inﬁnite, if you want to ﬁnd the endpoints of line segments in the image you can use
the edge map to try to ﬁnd them.

Exercises

1. Use optical ﬂow to build a simple gesture recognition system. For example, you
could sample the ﬂow as in the plotting function and use these sample vectors as
input.

2. There are two Warp functions available in OpenCV, cv2.warpAffine() and cv2.warpPerspective()
Try to use them on some of the examples from Chapter 3.

3. Use the ﬂood ﬁll function to do background subtraction on the Oxford "dinosaur"
images used in Figure 10.7. Create new images with the dinosaur placed on a
different color background or on a different image.
