Try this out and measure the difference graph size and in segmentation time
compared to the simpler construction we used.

. Create a user interface or simulate a user selecting regions for graph cut seg-

mentation. Then try "hard coding" background and foreground by setting weights
to some large value.

. Change the feature vector in the graph cut segmentation from a RGB vector to

some other descriptor. Can you improve on the segmentation results?

. Implement an iterative segmentation approach using graph cut where a current

segmentation is used to train new foreground and background models for the
next. Does it improve segmentation quality?

. The Microsoft Research Grab Cut dataset contains ground truth segmentation

maps. Implement a function that measures the segmentation error and evaluate
different settings and some of the ideas in the exercises above.

. Try to vary the parameters of the normalized cuts edge weight and see how they

affect the eigenvector images and the segmentation result.

. Compute image gradients on the Ô¨Årst normalized cuts eigenvectors. Combine

these gradient images to detect image contours of objects.

. Implement a linear search over the threshold value for the de-noised image in

Chan-Vese segmentation. For each threshold, store the energy E(F) and pick the
segmentation with the lowest value.
