Image Datasets

B. 1 Flickr

The immensely popular photo sharing site Flickr (http : //flickr . com/) is a gold mine
for computer vision researchers and hobbyists. With hundreds of millions of images,
many of them tagged by users, it is a great resource to get training data or for do-
ing experiments on real data. Flickr has an API for interfacing with the service that
makes it possible to upload, download and annotate images (and much more). A full
description of the API is available here http : //flickr. com/se rvices/¢api/ and there
are kits for many programming languages, including Python.

Let's look at using a library called ﬂickrpy available freely at http : // code .goog1e.
com/p/flickrpy/. Download the ﬁle f11'ckr.py. You will need an API Key from Flickr
to get this to work. Keys are free for non-commercial use and can be requested for
commercial use. Just click the link "Apply for a new API Key" on the Flickr API page
and follow the instructions. Once you have an API key, open ﬂ1'ckr.py and replace the
empty string on the line

API,KEY = "

with your key. It should look something like this:
APLKEY = 'l23fbbb8l441231l23cgg5bl23d92l23'

Let's create a simple command line tool that downloads images tagged with a par-
ticular tag. Add the following code to a new ﬁle called tagdown1oad.py.
import flickr
import urllib, urlparse

import os
import sys
