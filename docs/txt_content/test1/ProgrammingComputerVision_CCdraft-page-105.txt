image plane and the line joining the 3D point X and the camera center C. The dashed
line is the optical axis of the camera.

the optical axis intersects the image plane. Since this is usually in the center of the
image and image coordinates are measured from the top left corner, these values are
often well approximated with half the width and height of the image. It is worth noting
that in this last case the only unknown variable is the focal length f.

Projecting 3D points

Let's create a camera class to handle all operations we need for modeling cameras
and projections.

from scipy import linalg

class Camera(object):
”"" Class for representing pin-hole cameras. ”""

def ,_init_,(self,P):
”"" Initialize P = K[R|t] camera model. ”""

self.P = P

self.K = None # calibration matrix
self.R = None # rotation

self.t = None # translation

self.c = None # camera center
