version is less noisy but also has less detail than the standard version.

Exercises

1. Use the techniques introduced in this chapter to verify matches in the White
house example on page 66 (or even better, an example of your own) and see if
you can improve on the results.

2. Compute feature matches for an image pair and estimate the fundamental ma-
trix. Use the epipolar lines to do a second pass to ﬁnd more matches by searching
for the best match along the epipolar line for each feature.

3. Take a set with three or more images. Pick one pair and compute 3D points
and camera matrices. Match features to the remaining images to get correspon-
dences. Then take the 3D points for the correspondences and compute camera
matrices for the other images using resection. Plot the 3D points and the camera
positions. Use a set of your own or one of the Oxford multi-View sets.

4. Implement a stereo version that uses sum of squared differences (SSD) instead
of NCC using ﬁltering the same way as in the NCC example.
