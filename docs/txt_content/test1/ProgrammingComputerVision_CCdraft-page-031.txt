The last parameter indicates that integer format should be used. Similarly, reading is
done like this:

X = 1oadtxt('test.txt')

You can ﬁnd out more from the online documentation http : //docs . scipy.org/doc/
numpy/ reference/generated/numpy . loadtxt . html.

Lastly, NumPy has dedicated functions for saving and loading arrays. Look for save()
and load() in the online documentation for the details.

1.4 SciPy

SciPy (http : //scipy . org/) is an open-source package for mathematics that builds on
NumPy and provides efﬁcient routines for a number of operations, including numerical
integration, optimization, statistics, signal processing, and most importantly for us,
image processing. As the following will show, there are many useful modules in SciPy.
SciPy is free and available at http://scipy . org/Download.

Blurring images

A classic and very useful example of image convolution is Gaussian blurring of images.
In essence, the (grayscale) image I is convolved with a Gaussian kernel to create a
blurred version

I0 2: I'* (10 ,

where * indicates convolution and GU is a Gaussian 2D-kernel with standard deviation
0 deﬁned as
G0 : Le—<m2+y2>/2a2 _
27r0

Gaussian blurring is used to deﬁne an image scale to work in, for interpolation, for
computing interest points, and in many more applications.

SciPy comes with a module for ﬁltering called scipy.ndimage.fi1ters that can be
used to compute these convolutions using a fast 1D separation. All you need to do is:

from PIL import Image
from numpy import *
from scipy.ndimage import filters

im = array(Image.open('empire.jpg').convert('L'))
im2 = filters.gaussian,fi1ter(im,5)

Here the last parameter of gaussian_fi1ter() is the standard deviation.
