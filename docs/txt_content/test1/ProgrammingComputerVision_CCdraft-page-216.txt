gesture images. (images from the Static Hand Posture Database)

all images. Again, assuming the ﬁlenames are in a list 1'm11's1:, this is done like this.

import dsift

# process images at fixed size (50,50)

for filename in imlist:
featfile = fi1ename[:—3]+'dsift'
dsift.process_image_dsift(fi1ename,featfi1e,10,5,resize=(50,50))

This creates feature ﬁles for each image with the extension ".dsift". Note the resizing
of the images to some common ﬁxed size. This is very important, otherwise your
images will have varying number of descriptors and therefore varying length of the
feature vectors. This will cause errors when comparing them later. Plotting the images
with the descriptors looks like in Figure 8.3.
