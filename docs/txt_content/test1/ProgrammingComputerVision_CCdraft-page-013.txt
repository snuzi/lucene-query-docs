Chapter 1

Basic Image Handling and
Processing

This chapter is an introduction to handling and processing images. With extensive ex-
amples, it explains the central Python packages you will need for working with images.
This chapter introduces the basic tools for reading images, converting and scaling im-
ages, computing derivatives, plotting or saving results, and so on. We will use these
throughout the remainder of the book.

1.1 PIL — the Python Imaging Library

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) provides general image handling and lots of useful
basic image operations like resizing, cropping, rotating, color conversion and much
more. PIL is free and available from http://www.pythonwa re . com/products/pil/.

With PIL you can read images from most formats and write to the most common
ones. The most important module is the Image module. To read an image use

from PIL import Image
pil,im = Image.open('empire.jpg')

The return value, p1'1_1'm, is a PIL image object.
Color conversions are done using the convert() method. To read an image and
convert it to grayscale, just add convert(’L’) like this:

pil,im = Image.open('empire.jpg').convert('L')

Here are some examples taken from the PIL documentation, available at http : //
