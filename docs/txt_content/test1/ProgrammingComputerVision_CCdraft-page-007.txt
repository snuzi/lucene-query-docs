Preface

Today, images and video are everywhere. Online photo sharing sites and social net-
works have them in the billions. Search engines will produce images of just about any
conceivable query. Practically all phones and computers come with built in cameras.
It is not uncommon for people to have many gigabytes of photos and videos on their
devices.

Programming a computer and designing algorithms for understanding what is in
these images is the Ô¨Åeld of computer vision. Computer vision powers applications like
image search, robot navigation, medical image analysis, photo management and many
more.

The idea behind this book is to give an easily accessible entry point to hands-on
computer vision with enough understanding of the underlying theory and algorithms
to be a foundation for students, researchers and enthusiasts. The Python programming
language, the language choice of this book, comes with many freely available powerful
modules for handling images, mathematical computing and data mining.

When writing this book I have had the following principles as a guideline. The book
should:

- be written in an exploratory style. Encourage readers to follow the examples on
their computers as they are reading the text.

- promote and use free and open software with a low learning threshold. Python
was the obvious choice.

- be complete and self-contained. Not complete as in covering all of computer vi-
sion (this book is far from that!) but rather complete in that all code is presented
and explained. The reader should be able to reproduce the examples and build
upon them directly.

- be broad rather than detailed, inspiring and motivational rather than theoretical.

In short: act as a source of inspiration for those interested in programming computer
vision applications.
