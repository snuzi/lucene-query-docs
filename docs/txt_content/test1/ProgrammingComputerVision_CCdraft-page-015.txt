”"" Returns a list of filenames for
all jpg images in a directory. ”""

return [os.path.join(path,f) for f in os.listdir(path) if f.endswith('.jpg')]

Now, back to PIL.

Create thumbnails

Using PIL to create thumbnails is very simple. The thumbnai1() method takes a tuple
specifying the new size and converts the image to a thumbnail image with size that ﬁts
within the tuple. To create a thumbnail with longest side 128 pixels, use the method
like this:

pil,im.thumbnail((128,128))

Copy and paste regions

Cropping a region from an image is done using the crop() method.

box = (l00,100,400,400)
region = pil,im.crop(boX)

The region is deﬁned by a 4-tuple, where coordinates are (left, upper, right, lower).
PIL uses a coordinate system with (0, O) in the upper left corner. The extracted region
can for example be rotated and then put back using the paste() method like this:

region = region.transpose(Image.ROTATE,l80)
pil,im.paste(region,box)

Resize and rotate

To resize an image, call resize() with a tuple giving the new size.

out = pil,im.resize((l28,l28))

To rotate an image, use counter clockwise angles and rotate() like this:

out = pil_im.rotate(45)

Some examples are shown in Figure 1.1. The leftmost image is the original, followed
by a grayscale version, a rotated crop pasted in, and a thumbnail image.
