Alternatively, download the source code from http : // code . google . com/ p/ pyt hon - g raph/

To write and visualize the graphs (using the DOT language) you need python-graph-dot
which comes with the download or through easy_install:

Python-graph-dot depends on pydot, see above. The documentation (in html) is in the
"docs/" folder.

Simplejson is the independently maintained version of the JSON module that comes
with later versions of python (2.6 or later). The syntax is the same for both modules
but simplejson is more optimized and will give better performance.

To install, go to the project page https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson
and click the Download button. Then select the latest version from the "Download
Packages" section (currently this is 2.1.3). Unzip the folder and type

$ python setup.py install

from the command line. This should be all you need.
