5.3 Multiple View Reconstruction

Let's look at how to use the concepts above to compute an actual 3D reconstruction
from a pair of images. Computing a 3D reconstruction like this is usually referred to
as structure from motion (StM) since the motion of a camera (or cameras) give you
3D structure.

Assuming the camera has been calibrated, the steps are as follows:

1. Detect feature points and match them between the two images.
2. Compute the fundamental matrix from the matches.

3. Compute the camera matrices from the fundamental matrix.

4. Triangulate the 3D points.

We have all the tools to do this but we need a robust way to compute a fundamental ma-
trix when the point correspondences between the images contain incorrect matches.

Robust fundamental matrix estimation

Similar to when we needed a robust way to compute homographies (Section 3.3),
we also need to be able to estimate a fundamental matrix when there is noise and
incorrect matches. As before we will use RANSAC, this time combined with the eight
point algorithm. It should be mentioned that the eight point algorithm breaks down
for planar scenes so you cannot use it for scenes where the scene points are all on a
plane.
Add this class to sfm.py.

class RansacModel(object):
""" Class for fundmental matrix fit with ransac.py from
http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/RANSAC”"”

def iiinitii(self,debug=False):
self.debug = debug

def fit(self,data):
""" Estimate fundamental matrix using eight
selected correspondences. """

# transpose and split data into the two point sets
data = data.T

x1 = data[:3,:8]

x2 data[3:,:8]
