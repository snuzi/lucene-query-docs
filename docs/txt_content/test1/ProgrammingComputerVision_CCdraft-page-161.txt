Clustering Images

This chapter introduces several clustering methods and shows how to use them for
clustering images for ﬁnding groups of similar images. Clustering can be used for
recognition, for dividing data sets of images and for organization and navigation. We
also look at using clustering for visualizing similarity between images.

6. 1 K-means Clustering

K -means is a very simple clustering algorithm that tries to partition the input data in
k clusters. K -means works by iteratively reﬁning an initial estimate of class centroids
as follows:

1. Initialize centroids pl-, 2' = 1 . . . k, randomly or with some guess.
2. Assign each data point to the class 01' of its nearest centroid.
3. Update the centroids as the average of all data points assigned to that class.
4. Repeat 2 & 3 until convergence.
K -means tries to minimize the total within-class variance
k:
V=Z :(Xj—Hz')2a
i=1 Xj Ecz-

where xj are the data vectors. The algorithm above is a heuristic reﬁnement algorithm
that works ﬁne for most cases but does not guarantee that the best solution is found.
To avoid the effects of choosing a bad centroid initialization, the algorithm is often
run several times with different initialization centroids. Then the solution with lowest
variance V is selected.
