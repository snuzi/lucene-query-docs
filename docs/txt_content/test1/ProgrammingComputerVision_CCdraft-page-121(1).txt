g1Materia1fv(GL,FRONT,GL,AMBIENT,[0,0,0,0])
g1Materia1fv(GL,FRONT,GL,DIFFUSE,[0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0])

The ﬁrst two lines enable lighting and a light. Lights are numbered as GL_LIGHTO,
GL_LIGHT1, etc. We will only use one light in this example. The g1Enab1e() function
is used to turn on OpenGL features. These are deﬁned with uppercase constants.
Turning off a feature is done with the corresponding function g1Disab1e(). Next depth
testing is turned on so that objects are rendered according to their depth (so that far
away objects are not drawn in front of near objects) and the depth buffer is cleared.
Next the material properties of the object, such as the diffuse and specular colors, are
speciﬁed. The last line adds a solid Utah teapot with the speciﬁed material properties.

Tying it all together

The full script for generating an image like the one in Figure 4.5 looks like this (as-
suming that you also have the functions introduced above in the same ﬁle).

from 0penGL.GL import *
from 0penGL.GLU import *
from 0penGL.GLUT import *
import pygame, pygame.image
from pygame.1oca1s import *
import pickle

width,height = l000,747

def setup():
”"" Setup window and pygame environment. ”""
pygame.init()
pygame.disp1ay.set_mode((width,height),0PENGL | DOUBLEBUF)
pygame.disp1ay.set_caption('0penGL AR demo’)

# load camera data

with open('ar_camera.pk1','r') as f:
K = pickle.load(f)
Rt = pick1e.1oad(f)

setup()
draw_background('book,perspective.bmp')
set,projection_from_camera(K)
set_mode1viewLfrom,camera(Rt)
draw_teapot(0.02)
