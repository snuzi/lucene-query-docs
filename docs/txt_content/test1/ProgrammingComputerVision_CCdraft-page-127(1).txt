Chapter 5

Multiple View Geometry

This chapter will show you how to handle multiple views and how to use the geometric
relationships between them to recover camera positions and 3D structure. With im-
ages taken at different view points it is possible to compute 3D scene points as well as
camera locations from feature matches. We introduce the necessary tools and show
a complete 3D reconstruction example. The last part of the chapter shows how to
compute dense depth reconstructions from stereo images.

5. 1 Epipolar Geometry

Multiple View geometry is the ﬁeld studying the relationship between cameras and
features when there are correspondences between many images that are taken from
varying viewpoints. The image features are usually interest points and we will focus
on that case throughout this chapter. The most important constellation is two-view
geometry.

With two views of a scene and corresponding points in these views there are ge-
ometric constraints on the image points as a result of the relative orientation of the
cameras, the properties of the cameras, and the position of the 3D points. These ge-
ometric relationships are described by what is called ep1'po1ar geometry. This section
will give a very short description of the basic components we need. For more details
on the subject see [13].

Without any prior knowledge of the cameras, there is an inherent ambiguity in that
a 3D point, X, transformed with an arbitrary (4 X4) homography H as H X will have the
same image point in a camera PH ‘1 as the original point in the camera P. Expressed
with the camera equation, this is

Ax = PX = PH—1HX = PX .
