Now let's see how this affects the mean image. Figure 3.7 shows the mean image
for the unaligned face images next to the mean image of the aligned images (note
the size difference due to cropping the borders of the aligned images). Although the
original images show very little variation in size of the face, rotation and position, the
effects on the mean computation is drastic.

Not surprisingly, using badly registered images also has a drastic impact on the
computation of principal components. Figure 3.8 shows the result of PCA on the ﬁrst
150 images from this set without and with registration. Just as with the mean image,
the PCA-modes are blurry. When computing the principal components we used a mask
consisting of an ellipse centered around the mean face position. By multiplying the
images with this mask before stacking them we can avoid bringing background vari-
ations into the PCA-modes. Just replace the line that creates the matrix in the PCA
example in Section 1.3 (page 29) with:

immatrix = array([mask*array(Image.open(im1ist[i]).convert('L')).f1atten()
for i in range(l50)],'f')

where mask is a binary image of the same size, already ﬂattened.

3.3 Creating Panoramas

Two (or more) images that are taken at the same location (that is, the camera position
is the same for the images) are homographically related. This is frequently used for
creating panoramic images where several images are stitched together into one big
mosaic. In this section we will explore how this is done.
