Figure 4.6: Loading a 3D model from an .obj ﬁle and placing it on a book in a scene
using camera parameters computed from feature matches.

Exercises

1. Modify the example code for the motion in Figure 4.2 to transform the points
instead of the camera. You should get the same plot. Experiment with different
transformations and plot the results.

2. Some of the Oxford multi-View datasets have camera matrices given. Compute
the camera positions for one of the sets an plot the camera path. Does it match
with what you are seeing in the images?

3. Take some images of a scene with a planar marker or object. Match features to a
full frontal image to compute the pose of each image's camera location. Plot the
camera trajectory and the plane of the marker. Add the feature points if you like.

4. In our augmented reality example we assumed the object to be placed at the
origin and applied only the cameras position to the model View matrix. Modify
the example to place several objects at different locations by adding the object
transformation to the matrix. For example, place a grid of teapots on the marker.

5. Take a look at the online documentation for .obj model ﬁles and see how to use
textured models. Find a model (or create your own) and add it to the scene.
