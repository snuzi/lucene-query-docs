Figure 10.3: Sample SURF features extracted and plotted using OpenCV.

convert the grayscale image to a color image and use the green channel for plotting.
We loop over every tenth keypoint and plot a circle at the center and one circle showing
the scale (size) of the keypoint. The plotting function circ1e() takes an image, a tuple
with image coordinates (integer only), a radius, a tuple with plot color and ﬁnally the
line thickness (-1 gives a solid circle). Figure 10.3 shows the result.

10.3 Processing Video

Video with pure Python is hard. There is speed, codecs, cameras, operating systems
and ﬁle formats to consider. There is currently no video library for Python. OpenCV
with its Python interface is the only good option. In this section we'll look at some
basic examples using video.

Video input

Reading video from a camera is very well supported in OpenCV. A basic complete
example that captures frames and shows them in an OpenCV window looks like this.
