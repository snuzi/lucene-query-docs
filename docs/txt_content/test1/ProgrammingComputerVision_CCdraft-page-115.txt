Figure 4.4: Example of computing the projection matrix for a new View using a planar
object as marker. Matching image features to an aligned marker gives a homography
that can be used to compute the pose of the camera. (top left) template image with
a blue square. (top right) an image taken from an unknown viewpoint with the same

square transformed with the estimated homography. (bottom) a cube transformed
using the estimated camera matrix.
