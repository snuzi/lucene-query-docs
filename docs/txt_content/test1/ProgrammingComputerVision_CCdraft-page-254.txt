Figure 9.7: The piece-wise constant Chan-Vese segmentation model.

in Figure 9.7 the segmentation is given by minima of the Chan-Vese model energy

E(I‘) = A length(I‘) +[

(I— c1)2dx+[ (I — c2)2dx ,

which measures the deviation from the constant graylevels in each region, c1 and C2.
Here the integrals are taken over each region and the length of the separating curves
are there to prefer smoother solutions.

With a piece-wise constant image U = X101 + X202 this can we re-written as

E(r) = @ /|VU|dx + ||I — U||2 ,
where X1 and X2 are characteristic (indicator) functions for the two regions5. This
transformation is non-trivial and requires some heavy mathematics that are not needed
for understanding and are well outside the scope of this book.

The point is that this equation is now the same as the ROF equation (1.1) with A
replaced by )\|c1 — c2|. The only difference is that in the Chan-Vese case we are looking
for an image U which is piece-wise constant. It can be shown that thresholding the
ROF solution will give a good minimizer. The interested reader can check [8] for the
details.

Minimizing the Chan-Vese model now becomes a ROF de-noising followed by thresh-
olding.

5Character1'st1'c functions are 1 in the region and 0 outside.
