Reading video to NumPy arrays

Using OpenCV it is possible to read video frames from a ﬁle and convert them to NumPy
arrays. Here is an example of capturing video from a camera and storing the frames
in a NumPy array.

import cv2

# setup video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

frames = []
# get frame, store in array
while True:
ret,im = cap.read()
cv2.imshow('video',im)
frames.append(im)
if cv2.waitKey(10) == 27:
break
frames = array(frames)

# check the sizes
print im.shape
print frames.shape

Each frame array is added to the end of a list until the capturing is stopped. The
resulting array will have size (number of frames,height,width,3). The printout conﬁrms
