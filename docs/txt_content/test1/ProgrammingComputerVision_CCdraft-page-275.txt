marked by a user as "corrupt". The right image shows the result after inpainting.

The implementation in OpenCV uses an algorithm by Meyer [22]. Try it using the
command:

$ python watershed.py empire.jpg

This will open an interactive window where you can draw the seed regions you want
the algorithm to use as input. The results are shown in a second window with colors
representing regions overlaid on a grayscale version of the input image.

Line detection with a Hough transform

The Hough transform (http : //en .wikipedia . org/wiki/Hough_t ransfo rm) is a method
for ﬁnding shapes in images. It works by using a voting procedure in the parameter
space of the shapes. The most common use is to ﬁnd line structures in images. In that
case edges and line segments can be grouped together by them voting for the same
line parameters in the 2D parameter space of lines.

The OpenCV sample detects lines using this approachz. Try the following com-
mand:

$ python hough1ines.py empire.jpg
