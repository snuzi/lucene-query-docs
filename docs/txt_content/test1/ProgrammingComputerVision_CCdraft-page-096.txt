To ﬁt a homography using RANSAC we ﬁrst need to add the following model class
to homographypy.
class RansacMode1(object):

"““ Class for testing homography fit with ransac.py from
http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/RANSAC”""

def __init__(se1f,debug=Fa1se):
se1f.debug = debug

def fit(se1f, data):
"““ Fit homography to four selected correspondences. "““

# transpose to fit H_from,points()
data = data.T

# from points

fp = data[:3,:4]
# target points
tp = data[3:,:4]

# fit homography and return

return H,from,points(fp,tp)

def get_error( self, data, H):
"““ Apply homography to all correspondences,
return error for each transformed point. "““

data = data.T

# from points

fp = data[:3]
# target points
tp = data[3:]

# transform fp
fpitransformed = dot(H,fp)

# normalize hom. coordinates
for i in range(3):
fp,transformed[i] /= fp,transformed[2]

# return error per point
return sqrt( sum((tp-fpitransformed)**2,axis=0) )

As you can see, this class contains a fit() method which just takes the four corre-
spondences selected by ransaapy (they are the ﬁrst four in data) and ﬁts a homogra-
