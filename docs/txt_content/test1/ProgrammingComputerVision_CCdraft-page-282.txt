If you have all the dependencies in place, everything should build and install properly.
If you get an error like

import cv2

Traceback (most recent call last):
File ”", line 1, in

ImportError: No module named cv2

then you need to add the directory containing cv2.so to PYTHONPATH. For example:
$ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site—packages/

Linux

Linux users could try the package installer for the distribution (the package is usually
called "opencv") or install from source as described in the Mac OS X section.
