Prerequisites and Overview

What you need to know

- Basic programming experience. You need to know how to use an editor and run
scripts, how to structure code as well as basic data types. Familiarity with Python
or other scripting style languages like Ruby or Matlab will help.

- Basic mathematics. To make full use of the examples it helps if you know about
matrices, vectors, matrix multiplication, the standard mathematical functions
and concepts like derivatives and gradients. Some of the more advanced mathe-
matical examples can be easily skipped.

What you will learn
0 Hands-on programming with images using Python.
- Computer vision techniques behind a wide variety of real-world applications.

- Many of the fundamental algorithms and how to implement and apply them your-
self.

The code examples in this book will show you object recognition, content-based
image retrieval, image search, optical character recognition, optical ﬂow, tracking,
3D reconstruction, stereo imaging, augmented reality, pose estimation, panorama cre-
ation, image segmentation, de-noising, image grouping and more.

Chapter Overview

Chapter 1 Introduces the basic tools for working with images and the central Python
modules used in the book. This chapter also covers many fundamental examples
needed for the remaining chapters.

Chapter 2 Explains methods for detecting interest points in images and how to use
them to ﬁnd corresponding points and regions between images.

Chapter 3 Describes basic transformations between images and methods for com-
puting them. Examples range from image warping to creating panoramas.

Chapter 4 Introduces how to model cameras, generate image projections from 3D
space to image features and estimate the camera viewpoint.
