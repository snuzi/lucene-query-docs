10 and the similarity scores as the number of matching local descriptors. Only the
clusters with more than one image shown.

groups of a given size. Implement this small change and try it out on some real
data. How does it perform?

4. Experiment with using single and complete linking for building the hierarchical
cluster tree. How do the resulting clusters differ?

5. In some spectral clustering algorithms the matrix Dâ€˜1S is used instead of L. Try
replacing the Laplacian matrix with this and apply this on a few different data
sets.

6. Download some image collections from Flickr searches with different tags. Ex-
tract the RGB histogram like you did for the sunset images. Cluster the images
using one of the methods from this chapter. Can you separate the classes with
the clusters?
