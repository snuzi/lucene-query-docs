Appendix A

Installing Packages

Here are short installation instructions for the packages used in the book. They are
written based on the latest versions as of writing of this book. Things change (urls
change!), so if the instructions become outdated, check the individual project websites
for help.

In addition to the speciﬁc instructions, an option that often works on most plat-
forms is Python’s easy_install. If you run into problems with the installation instruc-
tions given here, easy_install is worth a try. Find out more on the package website
http://packages.python.org/distribute/easy_install.html.

A.1 NumPy and SciPy

Installing NumPy and SciPy is a little different depending on your operating system.
Follow the applicable instructions below. The current versions are 2.0 (NumPy) and
0.1 1 (SciPy) on most platforms. A package that currently works on all major platforms
is the Enthought EPD Free bundle, a free light version of the commercial Enthought
distribution, available for free at http : //enthought . com/products/epd_free . php.

Windows

The easiest way to install NumPy and SciPy is to download and install the binary distri-
butions from http : //www. scipy . org/Download.

Mac OS X

Later versions of Mac OS X (10.7.0 (Lion) and up) comes with NumPy pre-installed.
