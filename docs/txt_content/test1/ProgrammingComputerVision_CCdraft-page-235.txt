Exercises

1. The performance of the kNN classiﬁer depends on the value of k. Try to vary this
number and see how the accuracy changes. Plot the decision boundaries of the
2D point sets to see how they change.

2. The hand gesture data set in Figure 8.3 also contains images with more complex
background (in the "complex/" folders). Try to train and test a classiﬁer on these
images. What is the difference in performance? Can you suggest improvements
to the image descriptor?

3. Try to vary the number of dimensions after PCA projection of the gesture recog-
nition features for the Bayes classiﬁer. What is a good choice? Plot the singular
values S, they should give a typical "knee" shaped curve as the one below. A good
compromise between ability to generate the variability of the training data and
keeping the number of dimensions low is usually found at a number before the
curve ﬂattens out.

4. Modify the Bayes classiﬁer to use a different probability model than Gaussian
distributions. For example, try using the frequency counts of each feature in
the training set. Compare the results to using a Gaussian distribution for some
different datasets.

5. Experiment with using non-linear SVMs for the gesture recognition problem. Try
polynomial kernels and increase the degree (using the  parameter) incremen-
tally. What happens to the classiﬁcation performance on the training set and the
test set. With a non-linear classiﬁer there is a risk of training and optimizing
it for a speciﬁc set so that performance is close to perfect on the training set
but the classiﬁer has poor performance on other test sets. This phenomenon of
breaking the generalization capabilities of a classiﬁer is called overﬁtting and
should be avoided.
