. OpenCV has a function ccv2.findChessboardCorners() which automatically ﬁnds

the corners of a chessboard pattern. Use this function to get correspondences
for calibrating a camera with the function cv2.calibrateCamera().

. If you have two cameras, mount them in a stereo rig setting and capture stereo

image pairs using cv2.VideoCapture() with different Video device ids. Try 0 and
1 for starters. Compute depth maps for some varying scenes.

. Use Hu moments with cv2.HuMoments() as features for the sudoku OCR classiﬁ-

cation problem in Section 8.4 and check the performance.

. OpenCV has an implementation of the Grab Cut segmentation algorithm. Use

the function cv2.grabCut() on the Microsoft Research Grab Cut dataset (see Sec-
tion 9.1). Hopefully you will get better results that the low resolution segmenta-
tion in our examples.

. Modify the Lucas-Kanade tracker class to take a video ﬁle as input and write a

script that tracks points between frames and detects new points every k: frames.
