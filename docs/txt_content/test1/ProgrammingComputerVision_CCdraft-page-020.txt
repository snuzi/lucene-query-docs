with Matplotlib.

This plots an image and waits for the user to click three times in the image region of
the ﬁgure window. The coordinates [33, y] of the clicks are saved in a list X.

1.3 NumPy

NumPy (http : //www . scipy . o rg/NumPy/) is a package popularly used for scientiﬁc com-
puting with Python. NumPy contains a number of useful concepts such as array objects
(for representing vectors, matrices, images and much more) and linear algebra func-
tions. The NumPy array object will be used in almost all examples throughout this
bookl. The array object let's you do important operations such as matrix multiplica-
tion, transposition, solving equation systems, vector multiplication, and normalization,
which are needed to do things like aligning images, warping images, modeling varia-
tions, classifying images, grouping images, and so on.

NumPy is freely available from http : //www. scipy . org/Download and the online
documentation (http : //docs . scipy . o rg/doc/numpy/) contains answers to most ques-
tions. For more details on NumPy, the freely available book [24] is a good reference.

Array image representation

When we loaded images in the previous examples, we converted them to NumPy array
objects with the array() call but didn't mention what that means. Arrays in NumPy are
multi-dimensional and can represent vectors, matrices, and images. An array is much

1PyLab actually includes some components of NumPy, like the array type. That's why we could use it in
the examples in Section 1.2.
