Image to Image Mappings

This chapter describes transformations between images and some practical methods
for computing them. These transformations are used for warping, image registration
and ﬁnally we look at an example of automatically creating panoramas.

3. 1 Homographies

A homography is a 2D projective transformation that maps points in one plane to an-
other. In our case the planes are images or planar surfaces in 3D. Homographies have
many practical uses such as registering images, rectifying images, texture warping
and creating panoramas. We will make frequent use of them. In essence a homogra-
phy H maps 2D points (in homogeneous coordinates) according to

Homogeneous coordinates is a useful representation for points in image planes
(and in 3D as we will see later). Points in homogeneous coordinates are only deﬁned
up to scale so that x = [;r, y, w] = [om ay, aw] = [zr/w,y/10,1] all refer to the same 2D
point. As a consequence, the homography H is also only deﬁned up to scale and has
eight independent degrees of freedom. Often points are normalized with w = 1 to
have a unique identiﬁcation of the image coordinates ;r,y. The extra coordinate makes
is easy to represent transformations with a single matrix.

Create a ﬁle homographypy and add the following functions to normalize and con-
vert to homogeneous coordinates.
