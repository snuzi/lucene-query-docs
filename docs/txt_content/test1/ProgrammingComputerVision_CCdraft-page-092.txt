RAN SAC

RANSAC, short for "RANdom SAmple Consensus", is an iterative method to ﬁt models
to data that can contain outliers. Given a model, for example a homography between
sets of points, the basic idea is that the data contains inliers, the data points that can
be described by the model, and outliers, those that do not ﬁt the model.

The standard example is the case of ﬁtting a line to a set of points that contains
outliers. Simple least squares ﬁtting will fail but RANSAC can hopefully single out
the inliers and obtain the correct ﬁt. Let's look at using ransac.py from http://
www. scipy . o rg/Cookbook/RANSAC which contains this particular example as test case.
Figure 3.10 shows an example of running ransac.test(). As you can see, the algorithm
selects only points consistent with a line model and correctly ﬁnds the right solution.

RANSAC is a very useful algorithm which we will use in the next section for homog-
raphy estimation and again for other examples. For more information, see the original
paper by Fischler and Bolles [1 1], Wikipedia http : //en .wi kipedia . o rg/wiki/RANSAC
or the report [40].

Robust homography estimation

We can use this RANSAC module for any model. All that is needed is a Python class
with fit() and get_error() methods, the rest is taken care of by ransac.py. Here we
are interested in automatically ﬁnding a homography for the panorama images using
a set of possible correspondences. Figure 3.11 shows the matching correspondences
found automatically using SIFT features by running the following commands:
