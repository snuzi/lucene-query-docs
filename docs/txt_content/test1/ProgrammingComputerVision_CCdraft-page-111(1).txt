(right) the image used for the calibration. Measuring the width and height of the
calibration object in the image and the physical dimensions of the setup is enough to
determine the focal length.

translation) if the image contains a planar marker object. This is marker object can be
almost any ï¬‚at object.

Let's illustrate with an example. Consider the two top images in Figure 4.4, the
following code will extract SIFT features in both images and robustly estimate a ho-
mography using RANSAC.

import homography
import camera
import sift

# compute features
sift.process_image('book_fronta1.JPG','im0.sift')
10,d0 = sift.read_features,from_fi1e('im0.sift')

sift.process_image('book_perspective.JPG','im1.sift')
1l,dl = sift.read,features,from,fi1e('im1.sift')

# match features and estimate homography
matches = sift.match_twosided(d0,d1)

ndx = matches.nonzero()[0]

fp = homography.make,homog(10[ndx,:2].T)
ndx2 = [int(matches[i]) for i in ndx]

tp = homography.make,homog(11[ndx2,:2].T)

model = homography.RansacMode1()

H = homography.H,from_ransac(fp,tp,mode1)

Now we have a homography that maps points on the marker (in this case the book)
