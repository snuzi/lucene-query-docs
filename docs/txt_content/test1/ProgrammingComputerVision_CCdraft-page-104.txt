With a pin-hole camera, a 3D point X is projected to an image point x (both ex-
pressed in homogeneous coordinates) as

)\x=PX. (4.1)

Here the 3 x 4 matrix P is called the camera matrix (or projection matrix). Note that
the 3D point X has four elements in homogeneous coordinates, X = [X , Y, Z , W]. The
scalar A is the inverse depth of the 3D point and is needed if we want all coordinates
to be homogeneous with the last value normalized to one.

The camera matrix
The camera matrix can be decomposed as
P=K[R|t], (4.2)

where R is a rotation matrix describing the orientation of the camera, 1: a 3D transla-
tion vector describing the position of the camera center, and the intrinsic calibration
matrix K describing the projection properties of the camera.

The calibration matrix depends only on the camera properties and is in a general
form written as

af 5 cm
K: 0 f Cy
0 O 1

The focal length, f, is the distance between the image plane and the camera center.
The skew, s, is only used if the pixel array in the sensor is skewed and can in most
cases safely be set to zero. This gives

fr 0 Cm
K = 0 fy Cy , (4.3)
0 0 1

where we used the alternative notation f,, and fy, with f,, = Ozfy.
The aspect ratio, a is used for non-square pixel elements. It is often safe to assume
a = 1. With this assumption the matrix becomes

f 0 Cm
K: 0 f Cy
0 0 1

Besides the focal length, the only remaining parameters are the coordinates of the
optical center (sometimes called the principal point), the image point c = [c,,, Cy] where
