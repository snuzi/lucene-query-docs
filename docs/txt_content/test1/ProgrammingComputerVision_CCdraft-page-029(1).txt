Figure 1.8: The mean image (top left) and the ﬁrst seven modes, i.e. the directions
with most variation.

V,S,immean = pca.pca(immatrix)

subp1ot(2,4,1)

imshow(immean.reshape(m,n))

for i in range(7):
subp1ot(2,4,i+2)
imshow(V[i].reshape(m,n))

show()

Note that the images need to be converted back from the one-dimensional represen-
tation using reshape(). Running the example should give eight images in one ﬁgure
window like the ones in Figure 1.8. Here we used the PyLab function subp1ot() to
place multiple plots in one window.

Using the Pickle module

If you want to save some results or data for later use, the pickle module, which comes
with Python, is very useful. Pickle can take almost any Python object and convert it to a
string representation. This process is called pickling. Reconstructing the object from
the string representation is conversely called unpickling. This string representation
can then be easily stored or transmitted.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we want to save the image mean and

principal components of the font images in the previous section. This is done like this:
