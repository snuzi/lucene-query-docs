data. The bottom row shows a close up of the area around the points. The lines can be
seen to converge on a point outside the image to the left. The lines show where point
correspondences can be found in the other image (the color coding matches between
lines and points).

the epipole will be plotted as well (and computed if not passed as input). The plots are
shown in Figure 5.4. The color coding matches between the plots so you can see that
the corresponding point in one image lies somewhere along the same-color line as a
point in the other image.

5.2 Computing with Cameras and 3D Structure

The previous section covered relationships between views and how to compute the
fundamental matrix and epipolar lines. Here we brieﬂy explain the tools we need for
computing with cameras and 3D structure.

Triangulation

Given known camera matrices, a set of point correspondences can be triangulated to
recover the 3D positions of these points. The basic algorithm is fairly simple.
