Segmentation with user input

Graph cut segmentation can be combined with user input in a number of ways. For
example, a user can supply markers for foreground and background by drawing on an
image. Another way is to select a region that contains the foreground with a bounding
box or using a "lasso" tool.

Let's look at this last example using some images from the Grab Cut dataset from
Microsoft Research Cambridge, see [27] and Appendix B.5 for details.

These images come with ground truth labels for measuring segmentation perfor-
mance. They also come with annotations simulating a user selecting a rectangular
image region or drawing on the image with a "lasso" type tool to mark foreground and
background. We can use these user inputs to get training data and apply graph cuts
to segment the image guided by the user input.

The user input is encoded in bitmap images with the following meaning.
