Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into meaningful regions.
Regions can be foreground versus background or individual objects in the image. The
regions are constructed using some feature such as color, edges or neighbor similarity.
In this chapter we will look at some different techniques for segmentation.

9. 1 Graph Cuts

A graph is a set of nodes (sometimes called Vertices) with edges between them. See
Figure 9.1 for an examplel. The edges can be directed (as illustrated with arrows in
Figure 9.1) or undirected and may have weights associated with them.

A graph cut is the partitioning of a directed graph into two disjoint sets. Graph cuts
can be used for solving many different computer vision problems like stereo depth
reconstruction, image stitching and image segmentation. By creating a graph from
image pixels and their neighbors and introducing an energy or a "cost" it is possible
to use a graph cut process to segment an image in two or more regions. The basic
idea is that similar pixels that are also close to each other should belong to the same
partition.

The cost of a graph cut C (where C is a set of edges) is deÔ¨Åned as the sum of the
edge weights of the cuts

Ecut : Z wij 7 
(z',j)EC'
where wij is the weight of the edge (z', j) from node 2' to node j in the graph and the
sum is taken over all edges in the cut C.

1You also saw graphs in action in Section 2.3, this time we are going to use them to partition images.
