Searching Images

This chapter shows how to use text mining techniques to search for images based
on their visual content. The basic ideas of using visual words are presented and the
details of a complete setup are explained and tested on an example image data set.

7.1 Content-based Image Retrieval

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) deals with the problem of retrieving visually
similar images from a (large) database of images. This can be images with similar
color, similar textures or similar objects or scenes, basically any information contained
in the images themselves.

For high-level queries, like Ô¨Ånding similar objects, it is not feasible to do a full com-
parison (for example using feature matching) between a query image and all images in
the database. It would simply take too much time to return any results if the database
is large. In the last couple of years, researchers have successfully introduced tech-
niques from the world of text mining for CBIR problems making it possible to search
millions of images for similar content.

Inspiration from text mining - the vector space model

The vector space mode] is a model for representing and searching text documents. As
we will see, it can be applied to essentially any kind of objects, including images. The
name comes from the fact that text documents are represented with vectors that are
histograms of the word frequencies in the textl. In other words, the vector will contain
the number of occurrences of every word (at the position corresponding to that word)

1Often you see "term" used instead of "word", the meaning is the same.
