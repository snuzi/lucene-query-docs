Chapter 10

OpenCV

This chapter gives a brief overview of how to use the popular computer vision library
OpenCV through the Python interface. OpenCV is a C++ library for real time computer
vision initially developed by Intel, now maintained by Willow Garage. OpenCV is open
source and released under a BSD license, meaning it is free for both academic and
commercial use. As of version 2.0, Python support has been greatly improved. We will
go through some basic examples and look deeper into tracking and video.

10.1 The OpenCV Python Interface

OpenCV is a C++ library with modules that cover many areas of computer vision. Be-
sides C++ (and C) there is growing support for Python as a simpler scripting language
through a Python interface on top of the C++ code base. The Python interface is still
under development and not all parts of OpenCV are exposed and many functions are
undocumented. This is likely to change as there is an active community behind this
interface. The Python interface is documented at http : //opencv .wi1lowga rage . com/
doc umentation/ pyt hon/index. html. See the appendix for installation instructions.

The current OpenCV version (2.3.1) actually comes with two Python interfaces.
The old cv module uses internal OpenCV datatypes and can be a little tricky to use
from NumPy. The new cv2 module uses NumPy arrays and is much more intuitive to
usel. The module is available as

import cv2

and the old module can be accessed as

1The names and location of these two modules are likely to change over time, check the online docu-
mentation for changes.
