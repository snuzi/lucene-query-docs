Figure 1.9: An example of Gaussian blurring using the scipy.ndimage.filters module.
(a) original image in grayscale, (b) Gaussian Ô¨Ålter with 0' = 2, (c) with 0 = 5, (d) with
0 ::10.

Figure 1.9 shows examples of an image blurred with increasing 0. Larger values
gives less details. To blur color images, simply apply Gaussian blurring to each color
channel.

im = array(Image open('empire.jpg'))
im2 = zeros(im shape)
for i in range(3):

im2[:,:,i] = filters.gaussian_fi1ter(im[:,:,i],5)
im2 = uint8(im2)

Here the last conversion to "uint8" is not always needed but forces the pixel values to
be in 8-bit representation. We could also have used

im2 = array(im2,'uint8')

for the conversion.

For more information on using this module and the different parameter choices,
check out the SciPy documentation of scipy.ndimage at http://docs.scipy.org/
doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html.

Image derivatives

How the image intensity changes over the image is important information, used for
many applications as we will see throughout this book. The intensity change is de-
scribed with the x and y derivatives I3, and Iy of the graylevel image I (for color images,
derivatives are usually taken for each color channel).
