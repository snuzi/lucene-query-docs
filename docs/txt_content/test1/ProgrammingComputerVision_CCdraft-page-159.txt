5. Try smoothing the stereo depth maps using the ROF de-noising from Section 1.5.
Experiment with the size of the cross-correlation patches to get sharp edges with
noise levels that can be removed with smoothing.

6. One way to improve the quality of the disparity maps is to compare the disparities
from moving the left image to the right and the right image to the left and only
keep the parts that are consistent. This will for example clean up the parts
where there is occlusion. Implement this idea and compare the results to the
one-directional plane sweeping.

7. The New York Public Library has many old historic stereo photographs. Browse
the gallery at http://stereo.nyp1.org/gallery and download some images
you like (you can right click and save JPEGs). The images should be rectiÔ¨Åed
already. Cut the image in two parts and try the dense depth reconstruction code.
