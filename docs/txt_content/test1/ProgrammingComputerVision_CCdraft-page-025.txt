before transform

Figure 1.6: Example of histogram equalization. On the left is the original image and
histogram. The middle plot is the graylevel transform function. On the right is the
image and histogram after histogram equalization.

from PIL import Image
from numpy import *

im = array(Image.open('AquaTermi,1owcontrast.jpg').convert('L'))
im2,cdf = imtoo1s.histeq(im)

Figure 1.6 and 1.7 show examples of histogram equalization. The top row shows the
graylevel histogram before and after equalization together with the cdf mapping. As
you can see, the contrast increases and the details of the dark regions now appear
clearly.

Averaging images

Averaging images is a simple way of reducing image noise and is also often used for
artistic effects. Computing an average image from a list of images is not difÔ¨Åcult.
