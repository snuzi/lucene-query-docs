Inpainting

The reconstruction of lost or deteriorated parts of images is called inpainting. This
covers both algorithms to recover lost or corrupted parts of image data for restoration
purposes as well as removing red-eyes or objects in photo editing applications. Typi-
cally a region of the image is marked as "corrupt" and needs to be ﬁlled using the data
from the rest of the image.
Try the following command:

$ python inpaint.py empire.jpg

This will open an interactive window where you can draw regions to be inpainted. The
results are shown in a separate window. An example is shown in Figure 10.8.

Segmentation with the watershed transform

Watershed is an image processing technique that can be used for segmentation. A
(graylevel) image is treated as a topological landscape that is "ﬂooded" from a number
of seed regions. Usually a gradient magnitude image is used since this has ridges at
strong edges and will make the segmentation stop at image edges.
