Text is typeset according to these conventions:

Italic is used for deﬁnitions, ﬁlenames and variable names.

Typewriter is used for functions and Python modules.

small constant width is used for console printout and results from calls and APIs.
Hyperlink is used for URLs (clickable in the electronic version).

Plain text is used for everything else.

Mathematical formulas are given inline like this f (x) = wTx -|— b or centered indepen-
dently

f(X) =  +5,

and are only numbered when a reference is needed.

In the mathematical sections we will use lowercase (5, r A, 6, ...) for scalars,
uppercase (A, V, H, ...) for matrices (including I for the image as an array) and
lowercase bold (t, c, . . .) for vectors. We will use x = [12, y] and X = [X, Y, Z] to mean
points in 2D (images) and 3D respectively.

Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to everyone involved in the development and produc-
tion of this book. The whole O’Reilly team has been helpful. Special thanks to Andy
Oram (O’Reilly) for editing, and Paul Anagnostopoulos (Windfall) for efﬁcient produc-
tion work.

Many people commented on the various drafts of this book as I shared them on-
line. Klas Josephson and Hakan Ardo deserves lots of praise for thorough comments
and feedback. Fredrik Kahl and Pau Gargallo helped with fact checks. Thank you
all readers for encouraging words and for making the text and code examples bet-
ter. Receiving emails from strangers sharing their thoughts on the drafts was a great
motivator.

Finally, I'd like to thank my friends and family for support and understanding when
I spend nights and weekends on writing. Most thanks of all to my wife Sara, my long
time supporter.
