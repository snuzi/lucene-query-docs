Figure 9.8: Examples image segmentation by minimizing the Chan-Vese model using
ROF de-noising. (a) original image, (b) image after ROF de-noising. (c) ﬁnal segmen-
tation.

import rof

im = array(Image.open('ceramic-houses_t0.png').convert("L"))
U,T = rof.denoise(im,im,to1erance=0.001)
t = 0.4 #thre5hold

import scipy.misc
scipy.misc.imsave('resu1t.pdf',U < t*U.max())

In this case we turn down the tolerance threshold for stopping the ROF iterations to
make sure we get enough iterations. Figure 9.8 shows the result on two rather difﬁcult
images.

Exercises

1. It is possible to speed up computation for the graph cut optimization by reducing
the number of edges. This graph construction is described in Section 4.2 of [16].
