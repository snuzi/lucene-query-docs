Harris corner points are usually combined with a descriptor consisting of the graylevel
values in a neighboring image patch together with normalized cross correlation for
comparison. An image patch is almost always a rectangular portion of the image cen-
tered around the point in question.

In general, correlation between two (equally sized) image patches I1(x) and I2(x)
is deﬁned as

C(I1J2) = Zf(I1(X)»I2(X)) ,

where the function f varies depending on the correlation method. The sum is taken
over all positions x in the image patches. For cross correlation f (I1, I2) = I1 I2, and
then c(I1, I2) = I1 -I2 with - denoting the scalar product (of the row- or column-stacked
patches). The larger the value of c(I1, I2), the more similar the patches I1 and I2 are-1.
Normalized cross correlation is a variant of cross correlation deﬁned as

nCC(I1’I2) : ni 1 Z (I1(X:1’ H1) _ (I2(X()j2’ H2) ’ (2.3)

where n is the number of pixels in a patch, ,u1 and 112 are the mean intensities, and
01 and 02 are the standard deviations in each patch respectively. By subtracting the
mean and scaling with the standard deviation, the method becomes robust to changes
in image brightness.

To extract image patches and compare them using normalized cross correlation,
you need two more functions in harris.py. Add these:

1Another popular function is f (I 1, I2) = (I 1 — I2)2 which gives sum of squared differences (SSD).
