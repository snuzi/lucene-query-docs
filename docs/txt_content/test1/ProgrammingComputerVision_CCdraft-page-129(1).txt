Figure 5.1: An illustration of epipolar geometry. A 3D point X is projected to x1 and
x2, in the two views respectively. The baseline between the two camera centers, C1
and C2, intersect the image planes in the epipoles, e1 and eg. The lines 11 and 12 are
called epipolar lines.

The equation l1Tx1 = 0 determines a line with all points x1 in the ﬁrst image satisfying
the equation belonging to the line. This line is called an ep1'po1ar11'ne corresponding
to the point x2. This means that a corresponding point to x2 must lie on this line. The
fundamental matrix can therefore help the search for correspondences by restricting
the search to this line.

The epipolar lines all meet in a point, e, called the epipole. The epipole is actually
the image point corresponding to the projection of the other camera center. This point
can be outside the actual image, depending on the relative orientation of the cameras.
Since the epipole lies on all epipolar lines it must satisfy Fel = 0. It can therefore
be computed as the null vector of F as we will see later. The other epipole can be
computed from the relation e§F = 0.

A sample data set

In the coming sections we will need a data set with image points, 3D points and camera
matrices to experiment with and illustrate the algorithms. We will use one of the sets
from the Oxford multi-view datasets available at http : //www. robots . ox. ac . u k/~vgg/
data/data - mview. html. Download the zipped ﬁle for the Mertonl data. The following
script will load all the data for you.
