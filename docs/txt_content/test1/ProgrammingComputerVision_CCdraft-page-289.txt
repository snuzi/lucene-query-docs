where minx, miny, maxx, maxy deﬁne the geographic area to select photos from (mini-

mum longitude, latitude, maximum longitude and latitude, respectively). The response

will be in JSON and look like this:

{"count": 3152, "photos":

Using a JSON package you can get the "photo_ﬁle_url" ﬁeld of the result, see Sec-
tion 2.3 for an example.

B.3 Oxford Visual Geometry Group

The Visual Geometry research group at Oxford University has many datasets avail-
able at http://www. robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/. We used some of the multi-view
datasets in this book, for example the "Merton1", "Model House", "dinosaur" and "cor-
ridor" sequences. The data is available for download (some with camera matrices and
point tracks) at http://www. robots . ox.ac . uk/~vgg/data/data-mview. html.

B.4 University of Kentucky Recognition Benchmark Im-
ages

The UK Benchmark image set, also called the "ukbench" set, is a set with 2550 groups
of images. Each group has four images of an object or scene from varying viewpoints.
This is a good set to test object recognition and image retrieval algorithms. The data
set is available for download (the full set is around 1.5GB) at http: //www.vis . uky.
edu/~stewe/ukbench/. It is described in detail in the paper [23].
In this book we used a smaller subset using only the ﬁrst 1000 images.
