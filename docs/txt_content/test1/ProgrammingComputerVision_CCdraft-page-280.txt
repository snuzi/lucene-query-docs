An easy way to install NumPy and SciPy for Mac OS X is with the "superpack" from
https://github . com/fonnesbeck/Scipysuperpack. This also gives you Matplotlib.

Another alternative is to use the package system MacPorts (http : //www . macpo rts .
org / ). This also works for Mat plotlib instead of the instructions below.

If none of those work, the project webpage has other alternatives listed (http:
//scipy.org/1

Linux

Installation requires that you have administrator rights on your computer. On some
distributions NumPy comes pre-installed, on others not. Both NumPy and SciPy is easiest
installed with the built in package handler (for example Synaptic on Ubuntu). You can
also use the package handler for Mat plotlib instead of the instructions below.

A.2 Matplotlib

Here are instructions for installing Mat plotlib in case your NumPy/SciPy installation

did not also install Matplotlib. Matplotlib is freely available at http : //matplotlib.

sou rcefo rge . net / . Click the "download" link and download the installer for the latest

version for your system and Python version. Currently the latest version is 1.1.0.
Alternatively, just download the source and unpack. Run

$ python setup.py install

from the command line and everything should work. General tips on installing for dif-

ferent systems can be found at http : //matplotlib . sou rcefo rge . net/use rs/installing .

html but the process above should work for most platforms and Python versions.

A.3 PIL

PIL, the Python Imaging Library is available at http : //www . pythonwa re . com/pr‘oducts/
pil/ . The latest free version is 1.1.7. Download the source kit and unpack the folder.
In the downloaded folder run

$ python setup.py install
from the command line.

You need to have JPEG (libjpeg) and PNG (zlib) supported if you want to save im-
ages using PIL. See the README ﬁle or the PIL website if you encounter any problems.
