The accuracy above shows how many correct classiﬁcations there are for a given
test set but does not tell us which signs are hard to classify or which mistakes are
typically made. A confusion matrix is a matrix that shows how many samples of each
class is classiﬁed as each of the classes. It shows how the errors are distributed and
what classes are often "confused" for each other.

The following function will print the labels and the corresponding confusion matrix.

def print,confusion(res,1abels,classnames):
n = 1en(classnames)

# confusion matrix
classiind = dict([(c1assnames[i],i) for i in range(n)])

confuse = zeros((n,n))
for i in range(1en(test,1abe1s)):
confuse[c1ass,ind[res[i]],c1ass_ind[test,1abe1s[i]]] += 1

print 'Confusion matrix for’
print classnames
print confuse

The printout of running

print_confusion(res,test,1abe1s,classnames)

looks like this:

Confusion matrix for
[.A. .B. .C. .F. .P. .V.

[ 0. 1. 2. 0. 17 1.]
[ 3. 1. 3. 0. 14 24.]]

This shows that, for example, in this case "P" ("Point") is often misclassiﬁed as 

8.2 Bayes Classiﬁer

Another simple but powerful classiﬁer is the Bayes c1assiﬁer3 (or naive Bayes classi-
ﬁer). A Bayes classiﬁer is a probabilistic classiﬁer based on applying Bayes’ theorem
for conditional probabilities. The assumption is that all features are independent and
unrelated to each other (this is the "naive" part). Bayes classiﬁers can be trained very
