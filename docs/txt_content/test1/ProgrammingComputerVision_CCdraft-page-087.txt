important step in order to be able to do image comparisons and more sophisticated
analysis.

Let's look at an example of rigidly registering a set of face images so that we can
compute the mean face and face appearance variations in a meaningful way. In this
type of registration we are actually looking for a similarity transform (rigid with scale)
to map correspondences. This is because the faces are not all at the same size, position
and rotation in the images.

In the ﬁle jkfaces.z1'p are 366 images of a single person (one for each day in 2O08)3.
The images are annotated with eye and mouth coordinates in the ﬁle jkfaces.Xm1. Us-
ing the points, a similarity transformation can be computed and the images warped
to a normalized coordinate frame using this transformation (which as mentioned, in-
cludes scaling). To read XML ﬁles we will use minidom that comes with Python's built
in xm1.dom module.

The XML ﬁle looks like this:

<?xm1 version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<faces>
