A.4 LibSVM

The current release is version 3.1 (released April 2011). Download the zip ﬁle from
the LibSVM website http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cj1in/libsvm/. Unzip the ﬁle
(a directory "libsvm-3.1" will be created). In a terminal window go to this directory
and type "make".

$ Cd 1ibsvm—3.0
$ make

Then go to the "python" directory and do the same:

$ cd python/
$ make

This should be all you need to do. To test your installation, start python from the
command line and try

import svm

The authors wrote a practical guide for using LivSVM [7]. This is a good starting point.

A.5 OpenCV

Installing OpenCV is a bit different depending on your operating system. Follow the
applicable instructions below.

To check your installation, start python and try the cookbook examples http: //
opencv .wi11owga rage. com/documentation/python/cookbook. html. The online OpenCV
Python reference guide gives more examples and details http : / / open cv . willowga rage.
com/documentation/python/index . html on how to use OpenCV with Python.

Windows and Unix

There are installers for Windows and Unix available at the SourceForge repository
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibra ry/.

Mac OS X

Mac OS X support has been lacking but is on the rise. There are several ways to
install from source as described on the OpenCV wiki http://opencv.wi11owga rage.
com/wiki/Insta11Guide. MacPorts is one option that works well if you are using
Python/Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib also from MacPorts. Building OpenCV from source
can be done like this:
