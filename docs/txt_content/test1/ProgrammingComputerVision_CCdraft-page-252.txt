inal image and the resulting three-class segmentation. (bottom) the Ô¨Årst four eigen-
vectors of the graph similarity matrix.

It is worth noting that even for these fairly simple examples a thresholding of the
image would not have given the same result, neither would clustering the RGB or
graylevel values. This is because neither of these take the pixel neighborhoods into
account.

9.3 Variational Methods

In this book you have seen a number of examples of minimizing a cost or energy to
solve computer vision problems. In the previous sections it was minimizing the cut
in a graph but we also saw examples like the ROF de-noising, k-means and support
vector machines. These are examples of optimization problems.

When the optimization is taken over functions, the problems are called Variational
problems and algorithms for solving such problems are called variational methods.
Let's look at a simple and effective variational model.

The Chan-Vese segmentation model [6] assumes a piece-wise constant image model
for the image regions to be segmented. Here we will focus on the case of two regions,
for example foreground and background, but the model extends to multiple regions as
well, see for example [38]. The model can be described as follows.

If we let a collection of curves F separate the image into two regions 91 and 92 as
