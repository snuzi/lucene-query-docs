Local Image Descriptors

This chapter is about ﬁnding corresponding points and regions between images. Two
different types of local descriptors are introduced with methods for matching these be-
tween images. These local features will be used in many different contexts throughout
this book and are an important building block in many applications such as creating
panoramas, augmented reality, and computing 3D reconstructions.

2.1 Harris corner detector

The Harris corner detection algorithm (or sometimes the Harris & Stephens corner
detector) is one of the simplest corner indicators available. The general idea is to
locate interest points where the surrounding neighborhood shows edges in more than
one direction, these are then image corners.

We deﬁne a matrix M1 = M1(x), on the points x in the image domain, as the
positive semi-deﬁnite, symmetric matrix

_ T _ I,, _ Ii I,,Iy
M1 _vI VI _ Ly] [1, Iy] _ Lug I3] , (2.1)
where as before VI is the image gradient containing the derivatives I,, and Iy (we
deﬁned the derivatives and the gradient on page 32). Because of this construction,
M1 has rank one with eigenvalues A1 = |VI|2 and A2 = 0. We now have one matrix for
each pixel in the image.
Let W be a weight matrix (typically a Gaussian ﬁlter G,,), the component-wise
convolution
M1=W*M1, (2.2)

gives a local averaging of M1 over the neighboring pixels. The resulting matrix M;
is sometimes called a Harris matrix. The width of W determines a region of interest
