. For large vocabularies using arrays to represent the visual word frequencies is

inefﬁcient since most of the entries will be zero (think of the case with a few hun-
dred thousand words and images with typically a thousand features). One way
to overcome this inefﬁciency is to use dictionaries as sparse array representa-
tions. Replace the arrays with a sparse class of your own and add the necessary
methods. Alternatively, try to use the scipy.sparse module.

7. As you try to increase the size of the vocabulary the clustering time will take too

long and the projection of features to words also becomes slower. Implement a
hierarchical vocabulary using hierarchical k:-mean clustering and see how this
improves scaling. See the paper [23] for details and inspiration.
