1.2 Matplotlib

When working with mathematics and plotting graphs or drawing points, lines and
curves on images, Matplotlib is a good graphics library with much more powerful
features than the plotting available in PIL. Matplotlib produces high quality ﬁgures
like many of the illustrations used in this book. Mat p1ot1ib’s PyLab interface is the set
of functions that allow the user to create plots. Mat plotlib is open source and avail-
able freely from http://matplotlib . sou rceforge . net/ where detailed documenta-
tion and tutorials are available. Here are some examples showing most of the functions
we will need in this book.

Plotting images, points and lines

Although it is possible to create nice bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots, etc., only a few
commands are needed for most computer vision purposes. Most importantly, we want
to be able to show things like interest points, correspondences and detected objects
using points and lines. Here is an example of plotting an image with a few points and
a line.

from PIL import Image
from pylab import *

# read image to array
im = array(Image.open('empire.jpg'))

# plot the image
imshow(im)

# some points
x = [100,100,400,400]
y [200,500,200,500]

# plot the points with red star-markers
p1ot(x,y,'r*')

# line plot connecting the first two points
P10t(X[:2].y[:2])

# add title and show the plot
tit1e('P1otting: ”empire.jpg“')
show()

This plots the image, then four points with red star markers at the x and y coordinates
given by the X and y lists, and ﬁnally draws a line (blue by default) between the two
